If you imagine these in cave walls, would you be able to figure out what they are?

- duality of man -> virgin vs. chad
- Death accepted blindly -> ralph from simpsons
- Unwise Desire - guy looking at generational
- Loss
- Explaining to the uncaring
- Woman yelling at cat
- Easy choice, difficult decision - two buttons
- Scholarly ignorance -> "is this a pigeon"
- Rejection & Acceptance -> Drake No/Yes

How much can you abstract and reproduce and still recognize it.

## Conspiracies and Culture Wars
Content warning lol it.

Culture war is a concept that has been thrown about in the media, it's becoming no less relevant. than it is already.

James Hunter - Describe what he saw in an increasing level of polarization in the US. No logical, reasonable middle ground.

Things: Abortion, satarised on the simpsons. People are unlikely to take a middle ground in the debate. You either think it's murder, or you think that it should be a legal medical procedure that is safe and accessible. There is no rational middle between those two sides. Rights in the US, LGBTQ2+S rights, etc. should they happen?, compromise on a queer person's legal existance...

Partly because of this, we have seen these issues as either progressive or conservative. While there are modern progressive side, it's slower. Of course, though, these sorts of binaries between groups with no one outside of these 2 groups... There are different ways of achieving these goals, etc. But in these culture-war type issues, they're creating in/out groups in a polarized situation. This kind of reminds us of the Republican National Convention in 1992, where you're with us or against us. Pat Buchannan was one of the potential republican candidates in that election.

He gave a speech about bill clinton and himself a war for the soul of America. Clinton and Gore were the "evil" and Bush was on the "Good" side. He criticized clinton and gore for bringing up the most lgbtq favoured ticket in history... 

It's very much characterized in religious terms that the very soul or being of the country must be won by the right people.

It's not just a political philosophies. It's now a righteous struggle. George Bush Jr. did the same kind of thing on 9/11 and the war on terror. He used the word Crusade at one point as well. A righteous war. With the whole DT thing, it's amazing how many people have bought into this us vs. them world view.

It's not really possible to have a middleground when the two major sides are just so amazingly set against eachother and characterizing things in these kinds of absolutes. And so, what a culture war does is forces a framing of issues into good vs. evil. And so with each side being convinced in their righteousness. 

One of the book for this week were Hope for Harambe, one of the tounge and cheek arguments that... This news brought candle-light vigils to the gorilla. Rather there were memorials, memes, hashtags, etc. all honouring harambe. There was a racppn on the side of Younge and Church in toronto, calling out the city that someone should get rid of this animal on the side of a downtown street. By the afternoon, there was no cleanup in sight. So, these images started trending on twitter, etc. and by the afternoon, people created an impromptu memorial. 

All sides of the bandwagon used Herambe to further their own goals and agenda. 

Then trolls ruined everything, where liberals on the internet have a tendancy to take things too seriously. Internet trolls don't care about any of the sides of a culture war, by messing with people and pretending to be nazis for laughs, they created a safe space for actual nazi beliefs to proliferate.

And so, not only was this happening online, but through media platforms, the mainstream media caught onto it as well. This was a terrible thing that lead to conspiracy theories, and happened and lead to the normalization of conspiracy theories. What has evolved is public distrust in the media.

Trolls have a very large piece of the blame for this.
