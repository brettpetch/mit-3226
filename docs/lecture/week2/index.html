This is commentary on the celebrity culture. It just so happened that Manaj didn&#x27;t get vaccinated was disinvited was that it is a play on the popularity or play on the AOC&#x27;s dress, CNN, Fox News all covered this. Some kind of comment or opinion on this.</p><p>One way to get message to alot of people is to slap it on something that is already popular.</p><p>Now, onto more boring things.</p><p>Quick Recap: Last week we talked about what a meme is.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="meme-concept-artifacttext-or-ritual-that-is-something-that-you-do"></a>Meme: Concept, artifact/text, or ritual that is something that you do.<a class="hash-link" href="#meme-concept-artifacttext-or-ritual-that-is-something-that-you-do" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The S from highschool: a meme offline.</p><p>The idea of a meme is in itself a concept. The concept of a meme is in fact a meme.</p><p>it&#x27;s the idea of something, rituals, practices, drinking coffee in the morning or not drinking it at night... it&#x27;s a concept of a meme.</p><p>The concept of memes can be very tricky. You can have <strong>nested memes</strong>. If you pull back, things get a little bit weird.</p><p>For example, we could consider the concept of religion as a meme. Inside this meme concept, you can see different memes that conceptualize these meme manifestations.</p><p>God as a concept, it&#x27;s a non-tangible being. It lives in the abstract. God for example therefore is a meme as an idea. The bible, or the idea of a sacred text in itself is a meme. The manifestation of their religion is a meme.</p><p>What is a concept of practice that might be a meme, praying, memes within memes within memes = other memes.</p><p>This highlights one of the central problems. Memes are notoriously slippery and hard to pin down. But when you get into specifics, is this a single meme, a train of memes, or a bunch of memes. So we need to think about what a meme is.</p><p>If we think about Kermit the frog drinking tea as a meme, we think of a whole category of memes. Do we consider every mutation of the kermit the frog drinking tea meme, or do we consider each as being a meme?</p><p>It doesn&#x27;t matter much, it&#x27;s not useful to argue either side of this; The AOC meme with the tweet on it we can consider one meme, and a subset of the AOC @ metgalla with something on her back meme.</p><p>My opinion argues endlessly about what others do, and the other guy is wrong.</p><p>More usefully,</p><p>In Shiffman, we look at 3 concepts for memes</p><ul><li>Longevity, the concept of how long a meme lasts or persists in culture</li><li>Fecundity, the quality of how quickly / amount of times a meme is shared (the spread of the meme)</li><li>Fidelity, how accurately is the meme reproduced?</li></ul><p><img src="https://www.contentmx.com/website2/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tree-falls-in-forest.jpg" alt="If a tree falls in a forest and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"></p><p>^ philosophers might care, most people don&#x27;t.</p><p>These are 3 of the most foundational things to figure out if something is a meme at all. If it doesn&#x27;t last at all, it&#x27;s likely not worth talking about. If it doesn&#x27;t last a couple days on the internet, it&#x27;s likely not a meme.</p><p>What is one meme? The more accurately one meme sticks to a meme template will increase the longevity. People are more likely to react / share.</p><p>The fidelity of the meme, if you&#x27;re too conservative in how close it is to the original, you won&#x27;t get an audience, but in the other direction you won&#x27;t get any recognition for the meme&#x27;s roots.</p><p>If it doesn&#x27;t match these things, if it doesn&#x27;t get shared anywhere, if no one copies it, then who cares. If no one shares / it doesn&#x27;t keep going, it doesn&#x27;t matter.</p><p>This goes back to the argument, what is a meme. If it doesn&#x27;t have high fidelity, then is it longevity, or at some point did it split off and become its own meme. The idea of the meme comes from evolutionary biology, as discussed last week. species of animals, plants, etc. become other species. It&#x27;s hard to say where that split is.</p><p>That point is in a way kind-of arbitrary. If we look at Kermit with tea again, it might be all you need is just a character with a drink, you don&#x27;t have the meme any longer and you reset the counters. For the most part, unless you want to get into the weeds, a meme is a meme, which is related to other memes in a certain way. Whether you think of it one way or a bunch of ways entirely, in whatever way it benefits your arugment the most.</p><p>Now we&#x27;re going into a pre-history of memes.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="memes-before-the-internet"></a>Memes before the internet<a class="hash-link" href="#memes-before-the-internet" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Here we have the oldest known joke from sumeria about 100 years ago</p><blockquote><p>&quot;something which has never occured to me since time immomorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband&#x27;s lap&quot;</p><ul><li>Oldest known joke</li><li>Sumerian, circa 1900bc.</li></ul></blockquote><p>It&#x27;s a Q&amp;A joke,</p><blockquote><p>What hangs at a man&#x27;s thigh and has poked at a mans thigh that has poked at many holes before...</p><ul><li>it&#x27;s a dick joke</li><li>it&#x27;s really about a set of keys. the more things change...</li></ul></blockquote><p>Humans always try to form a connection to eachother. It&#x27;s one of the reasons that memes try to be funny.</p><p>Another kind of physical form of meme is graffiti. And basically, memes can be a way for an individual to make a long lasting mark on history, or their culture. Something like graffiti has a very long history. If you&#x27;re familiar with pompai, a place where a meme happened. One of the oldest forms of graffiti, &quot;x was here&quot;, insults aimed at enemies, enscriptions outside a brothel, &quot;weep you girls...&quot;</p><p>If you ever had the impression that romans and greeks were upper class, they were actually vulgar as hell. Memes have been used as expressions of resistance and rebellion. They push against the general social orders.</p><p>Memes created by social committees don&#x27;t perform well, but something your friend made was something that you may find funny.</p><p>On the bottom right, the shifman test ch.3 kilroy, little guy big nose peeking over wall. You might even find this around the city. It&#x27;s a simple, easy to replicate and fast-spreading piece of grafitti that made its way around after the world wars. Kilroy has no meaningful or obvious message to convey. All it did was serve as a way to connect people to paint/carve it onto something, you experienced a connection to someone else throguh time and space. You can consider it a mark of community. And like many internet memes today, you can think of it as being a signal of identity. It&#x27;s a symbol of people who get it, and those that don&#x27;t. &quot;who the hell is kilroy, and why is he here&quot; -&gt; you can put yourself into this commmunity because you&#x27;ve seen it so many times.</p><p>Usenet is an interesting piece of online history. It&#x27;s essentially &quot;each new communication medium &quot;. Usenet was a bulletin system where people could send and receive messages. Essentially a rudimentary email group, organized like an email newsletter of sorts where you could reply to the chain.</p><p>Because it was the 80&#x27;s, it had no support for images beyond simple text and characters. (limitation of computers). People would try to be interesting and creative. People tried to get around this limitation. If you don&#x27;t have images of faces, we&#x27;d use ;) and that&#x27;s a smiley face. Like people drawing starwars droids, a mark of pride or popularity concept on who could create the most interesting ASCII drawings. Before, even the WWW that we&#x27;re all familiar with today. Usenet users were not your average people, these were mostly academics or hobbiests with disposable income. People working for millitary, etc. The internet was a &quot;glorious nerd paradise&quot; for people who liked computers and things. In one of the most significant points in internet history was &quot;eternal september&quot;, the september that never ended.</p><p>The internet was mostly academic types who had access. They built up online pockets of nerd paradise. Every year in September would get an influx of freshmen with freshmen users. Unis would give students access to Usenet. People would dread every fall when young, inexperienced people would flood online groups. &quot;how do i do things&quot;. Would mess things up, create a nussance, people who were really into usenet would learn customs and become the next batch of online nerds. Then september 1993 happened, when AOL (America Online) decided that they&#x27;d offer Usenet Access to <strong>all of their subscribers</strong>. Instead of hundreds every year joining news groups, we had the entire us population coming onto usenet, flooding threads with spam, off topic commmments, and <strong>they didn&#x27;t stop coming</strong>! Everyone would get usenet accounts. This is when the &quot;normies&quot; took over the internet from the geeks that had made it their special place.</p><p>I would argue that this was one of the beginnings of internet trolling; outside of being an asshole, it started as a reaction to having idiot noobs trolling your online space, if you had your own hidden quiet cafe that&#x27;s outside of Richmod Row, it&#x27;s your cool nice place to get away from it all; imagine you went to this place and you&#x27;ve got the dumbest people on the planet buying out your favourite snacks, loudest people ever and ruin the entire vibe. This is kind of what Eternal Sepetember is like at the time.</p><p>There&#x27;s one academic that I follow is ... Coleman, talking about the beginnings of internet trolling &quot;trolls have transformed what were occasional &#x27;flame wars&#x27; into a set of cultural norms&quot;... Trolls work to notify the masses that there is still a class of geeks that will cause internet grief. One of the reasons I bring this up is that instead of just being antagonistic assholes if it were not for internet trolls.</p><p>In a way, just as Kilroy was a way of &quot;do you recognize this&quot; or not. Internet trolls became an internet. In-jokes were created in order to tell &#x27;us versus them&#x27;. If you were not, you would not, then they could make fun of you.</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Internet_dog.jpg" alt="internet dog"></p><p>One of the earliest memes, Something aweful, it was perhaps one of the first after usenet, one of the biggest online nerd and geek communities at the time. It was founded in 1999 and still exists today. &quot;Something Aweful&quot;. Members of this website, called &quot;goons&quot;, they had a thing called &quot;Photoshop Friday&quot;, where they&#x27;d take images and make them funny. One of the funny things they&#x27;ve done is &quot;birds with arms&quot;, which to this day i think is one of the funniest things on the interenet.</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Aybabtu.png" alt="All your base"></p><p>If you recognize this you&#x27;re cool, if not, you&#x27;re not.</p><p>Some of the moderation practices that persist to this day, the usual euphamisms, like regexing &quot;shit&quot; and changing it to &quot;poopoo&quot;, or &quot;shitty&quot; being changed for &quot;lovely&quot;. There&#x27;s another phrase that would be changed to &quot;gently caress&quot;. As the name suggests, Something Aweful was a breeding ground for depraved nerd humor and young dudes. One of the boards were ADTRW &quot;Anime Death Tentacle R*pe Whorehouse&quot;. Which created one of the worst internet forums of all time, 4chan. This website was created as a place without censorship, had complete freedom, and was quickly bombarded with internet libritarians.</p><p>This helped create a mix of edgy black humor, ironic rasism, sexism, bigotry, etc. 4chan was remarkably fertile in producing and distributing memes. This includes things like lulcats, rick rolling, and pepe. All of the &quot;classic&quot; memes were from 4chan. This also spawned the idea of the &quot;anonymous&quot; internet groups. One of their exploits was going to the houses of Scientology. They believed the organization was exploitative and &quot;destroys lives&quot;. This was one of the first times that people realized that &quot;weird shit&quot; happens on the internet. It&#x27;s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Chanology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project channology</a>. I mentioned that one possible source for history of memes was Encyclopedia Dramatica...</p><p>Reddit was the next big thing in the creation of memes. Reddit has become one of the highest traffic websites on the internet today. You can think of it as the succesor to 4Chan now. You can think of it as a nieche unknown website where cool funny people hang out and share funny memes and pictures of cats and stuff.</p><p>One of the reasons this mentality can persist is that there are alot of meta memes. About people that use reddit, about the website itself... One of the earliest memes was Narwhales and Bacon. This can be traced back to the internet being obsessed with bacon. This was around the inception of the Baconator, when a youtube channel existed called &quot;EpicMealTime&quot;, from montreal; decided to combine these thnigs and turn it into an old spy movie call and reply code phrase. The narwhale bacons at midnight. A prolific user on Reddit said &quot;here I am at Denver Collerado Airport&quot;, are any other users around. Reddit was still a small site at the time, and people on reddit found this and started saying &quot;how would redditors in real life recognize eachother&quot;. They&#x27;d put two things together. You&#x27;d introduce yourself but the codephrase was &quot;when does the narwhale bacon?&quot; the reply would be &quot;at midnight&quot;. If they give you the weirdest look, you&#x27;d walk away becasue who the fuck asks that question?</p><p><img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/319/narwhals.jpg" alt="Narwhals Bacon at Midnight"></p><p>This creates an insider feel. You often only interact with a few number of people. Some outside of reddit as well. some notable in-jokes and memes in history, the guy in the middle &quot;the rediculously photogenic guy&quot;. The guy that seemed handsome and not super sweaty.</p><p>Reddit was also infamously looking at surveillance footage to look for the boston marathon bombing, accused people of bombing that were not responsible. Because the name came out, they eventually took their own lives. It&#x27;s not really a lesson many people have learned unfortunately.</p><p>In 2015/2016, there was a subreddit called r/TheDonald. This was at least a semi-ironic play on Trump&#x27;s successful candidacy, but it&#x27;s not there anymore. From what I remember, it was at least a bit tounge-and-cheek. Things rapidly took a turn for the worse, and in 2016, it became less and less funny that Donald was running for president. It became less of a 4chan type board and morphed into a pro-support sub that praised trump. in 2019, TheDonald was quarunteened and eventually banned from reddit entirely.</p><p>Over the years, there has been alot of research into how things like this had on the 2016 election and even the election that happened today. More on that in a few weeks.</p><p>This is more or less the end of the super brief history of internet memes. One thing worth considering about this is the affordances of the platform that may affect the types of memes that may be distributed.</p><p>Usenet, Text based. 4chan, image memes. Reddit, insular memes, about things that happen on Reddit.</p><p>In more recent years, Facebook has become the place where the boomers live, like a legitimate post (see slides) that says</p><blockquote><p>It&#x27;s with great sadness in my heart that in my 49 year old son, Shane died this morning.
<img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/485/052/a1e.jpg" alt="Shane died this morning"></p></blockquote><p>This is how an idiot like Elon Musk gets to be a meme himself. I really don&#x27;t know alot about memes on IG, which is a very foco based platform, very image based. Look at where memes are created, where they circulate, and why?</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="analyzing-memes"></a>Analyzing memes<a class="hash-link" href="#analyzing-memes" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Internet memes can be treated as (post)modern folklore in which shred norms and values are constructed through cultural artifacts such as Photoshopped images or urban legends.

digital items sharing content, form, or stance transmitted over the internet by many users (41).</p><p>And so, based on Shiffman&#x27;s definition, there is a definition of what could be a meme.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="milhouse-is-not-a-meme"></a>Milhouse is not a meme<a class="hash-link" href="#milhouse-is-not-a-meme" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Frst, does anyone recognize this meme? It&#x27;s called the Treasury of Images, it&#x27;s a picutre of an image of a pipe that says &quot;this is not a pipe&quot;, its simply a representation of a pipe. What I&#x27;m getting at is that a meme version of this attempted to get at this
Nerdy, gullible, desperate for validation (what nerdy people feel like once in a hwile.) In the attempts to making him a meme was that an overwhelming response was to stop making Milhouse a meme. Becuase the internet works in weird ways, the millhouse is not a meme is a meme, but milhouse is not a meme is a meme.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="knowbel--lankshear"></a>Knowbel &amp; Lankshear<a class="hash-link" href="#knowbel--lankshear" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>In addition to Shiffman, is Knowbel &amp; Lankshear, 2007, they conceptualize 3 parts</p><ul><li>meaningful</li><li>social relations</li><li>values/beliefs/worldviews</li></ul><p>Stuart Hall, all of you are MIT, so you&#x27;ve gone over him ad-nausseum. Keep in mind that for this course, that the dominant, negotiated and oppositional readings.</p><p>Oppositional readings</p><ul><li>A reading where the receiver rejects and counters what the reader is saying. Takes an opposite understanding to what was intended.</li></ul><p>Negotiated</p><ul><li>Somewhere inbetween.</li></ul><p>Everyone is familiar with Bell LetsTalk. Bell pretends it cares about people and stuff. At the face of it, it&#x27;s a campaign to raise mental health awareness, Bell is being a sympathetic and caring corporation... Bell wants you to think about when you see the message.
A negotiated reading might think favourably about this campaign, but you might notice that they&#x27;re not acting outside of the intended look, as a corporation, this is advertising, but you may realize that this does more good than harm.</p><p>You know what bell is trying to sell you, you might consider this as nothing more than a corporation shamelessly appropriating social justice, the pain and suffering of people who suffer with these illnesses. It&#x27;s rediculously cheap compared to running a full ad-campaign. LetsTalk is really just a coverup of the unethical business practices that most corporations will engage in.</p><p>A more extreme opopsitional reading may not only advocate that we shouldn&#x27;t support it but rather that Bell Lets Talk is absolute garbage.</p><p>With these, we can see these turned into memes.</p><p>You might encode a meaning, indend for it to mean something, but you might consider this in memes as Pepe. You recognized pepe last week when we put him up on the slides. He&#x27;s a character created by Matt Fury, called Boy&#x27;s Club in 2005. Pepe is the right panel character in the comic. He&#x27;s a gross-weirdo-stoner type guy who&#x27;s not harmful but friendly. Perhaps because of his personality attributes, pepe took off on 4chan. On 4chan, he proved to be a very versatile character. If you talk about fidelity, that pepe blew this out of the water. Originally you had the &quot;feelsgoodman&quot;, in the middle you see pepe transforming into the face of internet meme cutlre</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/63/Feels_good_man.jpg" alt="feelsgoodman"></p><p><img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/017/188/pepe_meme&#x27;d.jpg" alt="pepe 4chan"></p><p><img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f2d/5a5/3faeb49bbf3deb992ad41ba04fca55788b-30-pepe-trump.rsquare.w700.jpg" alt="trump meme"></p><p>This frog turned into the predominant hate symbol on the internet. This was pushed by the ironic nazis on 4chan to legitimate adoption by non-ironic white surpremisists; piggybacking off this meme and furthering their own ideals. Because of it&#x27;s assocation with regular meme culture with not-horrific memes</p><p>The problem is that if you accept that argument, then you allow that ideology to spread, but if you reject it, you&#x27;ve got a bunch of people yelling about free-speech and what-have-you all over.</p><p>Point being, memes are complicated and not aways funny.</p><p>In another context, Pepe had a different context. Some of these were part of Hong Kong Protests.</p><p><img src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5d60252b7e0b9a0008192b86/master/pass/Culture_HK_1162663195.jpg" alt="pepe in hong kong"></p><p>Reimagined by the demonstrators to signify positive things like emergency responders or journalists.
