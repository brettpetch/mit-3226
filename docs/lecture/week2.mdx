Hello, welcome back. Most of you have submitted the first meme assignment. If you have questions we can troubleshoot, but otherwise, there are some interesting things I've seen already. I didn't realize that everyone assigns encoding and deconding.

About 20 mins ago, I had some coffee spill on the keyboard... If some weird slide changes happen, it's likely good that you've already read encoding and decoding before so we can look further into the other ones.

Tonight we're going to be looking at some specific things to consider when analize meme. This is a content warning

:::caution
This is a content warning. These memes will be anti-semetic, racist, sexist, etc.

To throw up something this week I saw on the internet. This is something I saw over the weekend,

![AOC in wedding dress at met galla. My cousin in trinidad won't get vaccine cuz his friend got it & became impotent. His testicles became swollen. His friend was weeks away from getting married. Now the girl called off rn wedding. So just pray on it & make sure you're comfortable with ur decision, not bullied.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/199/797/2ee.png)

Basically, what I'm asking you to do is to notice the things you see on social media, think about what is a saying and who is saying it to whom and my reading of this is that at the very least is a callout to Nikki Manaj is about how stupid the idea of having swollen testicles is. This is commentary on the celebrity culture. It just so happened that Manaj didn't get vaccinated was disinvited was that it is a play on the popularity or play on the AOC's dress, CNN, Fox News all covered this. Some kind of comment or opinion on this.

One way to get message to alot of people is to slap it on something that is already popular.

Now, onto more boring things.

Quick Recap: Last week we talked about what a meme is.

## Meme: Concept, artifact/text, or ritual that is something that you do.

The S from highschool: a meme offline.

The idea of a meme is in itself a concept. The concept of a meme is in fact a meme.

it's the idea of something, rituals, practices, drinking coffee in the morning or not drinking it at night... it's a concept of a meme.

The concept of memes can be very tricky. You can have **nested memes**. If you pull back, things get a little bit weird.

For example, we could consider the concept of religion as a meme. Inside this meme concept, you can see different memes that conceptualize these meme manifestations.

God as a concept, it's a non-tangible being. It lives in the abstract. God for example therefore is a meme as an idea. The bible, or the idea of a sacred text in itself is a meme. The manifestation of their religion is a meme.

What is a concept of practice that might be a meme, praying, memes within memes within memes = other memes.

This highlights one of the central problems. Memes are notoriously slippery and hard to pin down. But when you get into specifics, is this a single meme, a train of memes, or a bunch of memes. So we need to think about what a meme is.

If we think about Kermit the frog drinking tea as a meme, we think of a whole category of memes. Do we consider every mutation of the kermit the frog drinking tea meme, or do we consider each as being a meme?

It doesn't matter much, it's not useful to argue either side of this; The AOC meme with the tweet on it we can consider one meme, and a subset of the AOC @ metgalla with something on her back meme.

My opinion argues endlessly about what others do, and the other guy is wrong.

More usefully,

In Shiffman, we look at 3 concepts for memes

- Longevity, the concept of how long a meme lasts or persists in culture
- Fecundity, the quality of how quickly / amount of times a meme is shared (the spread of the meme)
- Fidelity, how accurately is the meme reproduced?

![If a tree falls in a forest and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound?](https://www.contentmx.com/website2/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tree-falls-in-forest.jpg)

^ philosophers might care, most people don't.

These are 3 of the most foundational things to figure out if something is a meme at all. If it doesn't last at all, it's likely not worth talking about. If it doesn't last a couple days on the internet, it's likely not a meme.

What is one meme? The more accurately one meme sticks to a meme template will increase the longevity. People are more likely to react / share.

The fidelity of the meme, if you're too conservative in how close it is to the original, you won't get an audience, but in the other direction you won't get any recognition for the meme's roots.

If it doesn't match these things, if it doesn't get shared anywhere, if no one copies it, then who cares. If no one shares / it doesn't keep going, it doesn't matter.

This goes back to the argument, what is a meme. If it doesn't have high fidelity, then is it longevity, or at some point did it split off and become its own meme. The idea of the meme comes from evolutionary biology, as discussed last week. species of animals, plants, etc. become other species. It's hard to say where that split is.

That point is in a way kind-of arbitrary. If we look at Kermit with tea again, it might be all you need is just a character with a drink, you don't have the meme any longer and you reset the counters. For the most part, unless you want to get into the weeds, a meme is a meme, which is related to other memes in a certain way. Whether you think of it one way or a bunch of ways entirely, in whatever way it benefits your arugment the most.

Now we're going into a pre-history of memes.

## Memes before the internet

Here we have the oldest known joke from sumeria about 100 years ago

> "something which has never occured to me since time immomorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband's lap"
>
> - Oldest known joke
> - Sumerian, circa 1900bc.

It's a Q&A joke,

> What hangs at a man's thigh and has poked at a mans thigh that has poked at many holes before...
>
> - it's a dick joke
> - it's really about a set of keys. the more things change...

Humans always try to form a connection to eachother. It's one of the reasons that memes try to be funny.

Another kind of physical form of meme is graffiti. And basically, memes can be a way for an individual to make a long lasting mark on history, or their culture. Something like graffiti has a very long history. If you're familiar with pompai, a place where a meme happened. One of the oldest forms of graffiti, "x was here", insults aimed at enemies, enscriptions outside a brothel, "weep you girls..."

If you ever had the impression that romans and greeks were upper class, they were actually vulgar as hell. Memes have been used as expressions of resistance and rebellion. They push against the general social orders.

Memes created by social committees don't perform well, but something your friend made was something that you may find funny.

On the bottom right, the shifman test ch.3 kilroy, little guy big nose peeking over wall. You might even find this around the city. It's a simple, easy to replicate and fast-spreading piece of grafitti that made its way around after the world wars. Kilroy has no meaningful or obvious message to convey. All it did was serve as a way to connect people to paint/carve it onto something, you experienced a connection to someone else throguh time and space. You can consider it a mark of community. And like many internet memes today, you can think of it as being a signal of identity. It's a symbol of people who get it, and those that don't. "who the hell is kilroy, and why is he here" -> you can put yourself into this commmunity because you've seen it so many times.

Usenet is an interesting piece of online history. It's essentially "each new communication medium ". Usenet was a bulletin system where people could send and receive messages. Essentially a rudimentary email group, organized like an email newsletter of sorts where you could reply to the chain.

Because it was the 80's, it had no support for images beyond simple text and characters. (limitation of computers). People would try to be interesting and creative. People tried to get around this limitation. If you don't have images of faces, we'd use ;) and that's a smiley face. Like people drawing starwars droids, a mark of pride or popularity concept on who could create the most interesting ASCII drawings. Before, even the WWW that we're all familiar with today. Usenet users were not your average people, these were mostly academics or hobbiests with disposable income. People working for millitary, etc. The internet was a "glorious nerd paradise" for people who liked computers and things. In one of the most significant points in internet history was "eternal september", the september that never ended.

The internet was mostly academic types who had access. They built up online pockets of nerd paradise. Every year in September would get an influx of freshmen with freshmen users. Unis would give students access to Usenet. People would dread every fall when young, inexperienced people would flood online groups. "how do i do things". Would mess things up, create a nussance, people who were really into usenet would learn customs and become the next batch of online nerds. Then september 1993 happened, when AOL (America Online) decided that they'd offer Usenet Access to **all of their subscribers**. Instead of hundreds every year joining news groups, we had the entire us population coming onto usenet, flooding threads with spam, off topic commmments, and **they didn't stop coming**! Everyone would get usenet accounts. This is when the "normies" took over the internet from the geeks that had made it their special place.

I would argue that this was one of the beginnings of internet trolling; outside of being an asshole, it started as a reaction to having idiot noobs trolling your online spacce. Your mom, your grandma
