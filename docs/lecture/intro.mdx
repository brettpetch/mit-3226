## Memes

### What is a meme?

First coined by Dr. Richard Docins, Evolutionary Biologist. Known for The Blind Watchmaker. Now an angry buligerant athiest on the internet.

1. An element of a culture or system of behaviour passed from one individual to another by imitation or other non-genetic means.
2. An image, video, piece of text, etc. typically humerous in nature, that is copied and spread rapidly by internet users, often with slight variations.

Everything is a meme by #1, we'll focus on number 2. This is closer to the idea of a meme you have.

Speaking of memes,
![Wednesday my dudes](https://www.kindpng.com/picc/m/111-1114795_wednesday-frog-png-wednesday-my-dudes-png-transparent.png)

Posted on a wednesday and caught on from there. This meme's appeal is that the frog has a vacant but adorable grin on his face. The fact it references wednesday gives it a constant form of repeition. Here, it's built to be re-posted every wednesday.

Helps to keep the meme in circulation, but helps regulate that it is only posted on a certain day. It's a natural eb-and-flow. You don't see it constantly so you don't tire as quickly. The frog has a longer-lasting popularity on the internet to this day.

It is helped along with the meme in addition to sound.

A guy created an entire year's worth of this sound. You'll see a link to the playlist in the notes after this.

The internet is made up of frog memes. See also: [Feels Good Man](https://trakt.tv/movies/feels-good-man-2020)

### Frogs

In the book of revelations

> I saw three impure sprits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
> Revelation 16:13

More or less, you'll take a meme, consider where it comes from, what it might be connected to and tell me about it.

## Course Organization

This course is roughly broken down to 2 parts. Weeks 1-4 will be spent on theoretical and analytical tools for approaching the understanding and analyzation of memes in this course.

In the 2nd half of the course, you'll be applying memes. After reading-week, we'll be doing the more 'fun stuff' like topics and cases in things like politis, conspiracies, gender, race, etc.

Class Timing: 10pm seems a bit late-- Would you prefer to take a short break in the middle or just power through and get out at 9?

### Readings

We don't have a textbook, they'll all be on OWL. The closest thing is Memes in Digital Culture by Limor Shifman (2016) but is still one of the most complete academic works in the study & analysis of memes. This is an e-book through Western Libraries. Let instructor know if you have issues accessing this resource.

Some of the readings can be a bit of a slog. Get through them before class each week. We'll be working on the assumption that you've at least tried to read them.

In the first 4 weeks, I'll expect to see that material in assignments, etc.

### Assignments

#### Make-A-Meme - 10%

10% 5 memes you make over the semester. You'll [find it on OWL](https://owl.uwo.ca/portal/site/e1067db1-11b0-4a0e-9ed0-ad3cdc5a6d6c/tool/7354d48e-91a8-4b1f-a507-dd0ac7f51dcd). You'll be evaluated with an 'unofficial' participation grade that will be used to hopefully bump up grades at the end.

#### Meme Presentation - 10%

You'll need to find a meme, create a presentation, tell us about it and tell us what it memes. There will be great questions at the end. Your choice if you'd like to submit in-person or do a voicethread/video presentation. If you have something in mind, put it down when you sign up.
2 parts: what is it, where from, etc. Variations are fine. You can change but put something down as a placeholder while you sign up. Do at least 1 week in advance.

1/2 what is this, 2nd half, what does it mean, how should we think about it?

#### Meme Analysis Essays - 30%

1000 words. Same thing as presentation, if kermit, what is muppet. Origin story, why is it being shared, what message is being encoded? Is it political, what is the undertone? Is it racist? Should we be concened that this meme is popular?

You can use the same meme for your presenation and 1 essay. Basically do one and turn it into the other. This is encouraged

#### Take-Home Midterm - 20%

Not a huge fan of midterms, but you'll be given a couple short form question and a long-form question. You might have 4 potential questions, pick 3, then for long answer, it could be 2 potential questions, pick 1.

#### Final Essay - 30%

Meme Analysis, but instead of just what it memes, take the entire genre and go through the varieties, why they have so many variations, what does it say about us, what is up with the people sharing / creating it, why is it a thing?

#### Late Policy

5% per day, send email before and Yimin will try to accomidate. Do it before the due date, or 5% per day and 1 week after will not accept it. Little bit proud, got the word butthole in a syllabus.

### Readings are actually required. Do the early ones.

If you have a better comms theororist, you can use those, you might want to run by Yimin first.

Because we're on mondays we have 11 weeks of class instead of 12. If weeven get this far, we'll look into that at the end.

The last essay might be extended _slightly_.

Refer to syllabus in its final form on OWL.

## How to talk about memes

If you want an example on how to discuss and analyze them, check out the [Reply All _Yes Yes No_ "#114 Apocalypse Soon" podcast](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/xjhewe).

Useful resources.

[Know your meme](htps://knowyourmeme.com)
[Wikipedia](htps://knowyourmeme.com)
[Urban Dictionary](https://urbandictionary.com)
[Reddit](https://redd.it)
[YouTube](https://youtu.be)
_wikipedia's evil twin_, [Encyclopedia Dramatica](https://encyclopediadramatica.online)

You can use figures, etc. for memes, etc. Screenshots, etc. You can also **use twitter threads but CITE THEM**.

### Essay Format

Not concened about format, just be consistent. Author, date, where to find at. If we cannot find a reference you are **wrong**, will be checked.

## Basically, **I'm Ancient**

While I will try to find interesting memes, I will use simpsons memes, I am not on IG or TikTok, Snapchat, etc. Modern trends are not my 'jam'. Most academics are old-asfuck. Twitter is still somehow the hot thing. No one has really touched TikTok. There isn't anything meme-related that's _current_

Consider me your old out-of-touch boss from the radio show and explain what the fuck is going on in the internet.

### When I stopped paying attention to the internet

Dogs chasing baby, etc. Take some time to look at stuff from the past, there'll be some other stuff. One more short video to show, but any questions?
