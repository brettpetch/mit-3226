## Housekeeping

Please ensure that you've signed up for a presentation. At the moment, the only presentation slots available are in the beginning or last week.

Are there any questions about the essay before we start? alright.

Basically this week, we're going to be taking a few of the ideas we talked about last week, creating a bit of a link between memes and culture. We're going to connect memes we see to cultures that produce them and that use them. So, why do we use memes in the first place? Where to we send memes to? And what might memes tell us about people who use/create/share them?

### Meme of the Week

The devious lick trend, take stuff from high school bathroom

![TikTokers wondering why the world hates them after they loot all thte bathrooms and destroy everything](https://ahseeit.com//king-include/uploads/2021/09/uqxbq0cfubp71-1788537605.jpg)

This brings up some assumptions of TikTokers. Is there anyone who hasn't interacted with TikTokers? I have some friends my age, they're friends of tiktok. Everything that's interesting is going to come to me on another platform. Tiktok seems to be like a generational marker. It's the assumption that Zoomers and millennials. In talk shows, old people try to decode tiktoks.

##### Comments

> I've never seen a generation have so much cancel culture from tiktoks, etc.
> Cancel culture, when someone says something on the internet then years later it becomes controversy. Common with celebreties.
>
> - Eric Santer

if something like this was in someone's internet history, would it be a basis to cancel them?

> Someone could be cancelled for licking the wrong thing.

What might have changed? Cancel culture is a generational conflict. Young people are overzelous about being SJWs and stereotyping would something they learned in a Womens Studies class, then they all the sudden care about that the same week.

## Readings

### Clifford Geertz

Ok, so for the readings. As one of the most influential anthropologists of the time, he studied things like semiotics as a way to better understand society in culture. Of course, memes being often in the forms of signs and symbols, it'd be relevant here. Fundamentally, the idea you should take out of his work is that culture is a web of meaning, it connects people, places, things and ideas. All of these things can be represented through symbols we use. "Small facts can speak to large issues". A meme that's associated with boomers on FB, something that's small can talk to larger issues.

So last week, we talked about Stuart Hall, encoding/decoding, encoded by sender, decoded by receiver, dom, opp, negotiated. Two seperate people can receive the same message and come with radically different interperateations of what that meant. We can use Geertz's work to build on this. Thick Description.

In a nutshell, he argues in Thick Description that you can't describe a culture superficially. You need a context of these things. Why do things look a certain way?

> Observing two boys winking

Thin description vs thick description. Closing and opening an eyelid because he has a twitch. This is not a communicative act. He's not trying to send information. The other boy is _actively winking_, for a purpose. To "send a conspiratorial signal to a friend". The very same action, but this time it's meaningful. It's a communnicative act and sends some kind of information. These two acts look the same if you really boil it down. If you took a photograph of these boys doing this act, you can't tell the difference without context. Even though it's basically the same act, the point that I'm trying to make is that one is meaningful, other is not. The third boy, winking in imitation of the 1st boy's involuntary twitch. Without communicative intent, this twitch movement is a parody or mockery of what the first boy is doing and that makes all the difference.

#### Thin Description

The difference is that thin description is that these boys are winking. You describe what you see.

#### Thick Description

Thick description brings in the context, what it's hoping to accomplish and why.

Irony or anger, in their occurance is the... If we apply this idea to memes is that we should be aiming for a superficial thin description that "these are just a bunch of emojis", where each of these memes lies in the web of meaning. What role does it play in overall culture and what is it connected to?

Thin description: eggplant with water squirting.

Thick description: you've already figured that out.

Thick description is hard. You need to know so many things.

If you looked at this on the boomer panel, what would you say about boomer humor? It'd be approval, etc. It's falling under dad-humor. Alot of millennials are reaching into the workforce, reflection of that. If you think about it, the way millenials are still characterized is that they've been kicked in the ribs their entire life.
