## Housekeeping

Please ensure that you've signed up for a presentation. At the moment, the only presentation slots available are in the beginning or last week.

Are there any questions about the essay before we start? alright.

Basically this week, we're going to be taking a few of the ideas we talked about last week, creating a bit of a link between memes and culture. We're going to connect memes we see to cultures that produce them and that use them. So, why do we use memes in the first place? Where to we send memes to? And what might memes tell us about people who use/create/share them?

### Meme of the Week

The devious lick trend, take stuff from high school bathroom

![TikTokers wondering why the world hates them after they loot all thte bathrooms and destroy everything](https://ahseeit.com//king-include/uploads/2021/09/uqxbq0cfubp71-1788537605.jpg)

This brings up some assumptions of TikTokers. Is there anyone who hasn't interacted with TikTokers? I have some friends my age, they're friends of tiktok. Everything that's interesting is going to come to me on another platform. Tiktok seems to be like a generational marker. It's the assumption that Zoomers and millennials. In talk shows, old people try to decode tiktoks.

##### Comments

> I've never seen a generation have so much cancel culture from tiktoks, etc.
> Cancel culture, when someone says something on the internet then years later it becomes controversy. Common with celebreties.
>
> - Eric Santer

if something like this was in someone's internet history, would it be a basis to cancel them?

> Someone could be cancelled for licking the wrong thing.

What might have changed? Cancel culture is a generational conflict. Young people are overzelous about being SJWs and stereotyping would something they learned in a Womens Studies class, then they all the sudden care about that the same week.

## Readings

### Clifford Geertz

Ok, so for the readings. As one of the most influential anthropologists of the time, he studied things like semiotics as a way to better understand society in culture. Of course, memes being often in the forms of signs and symbols, it'd be relevant here. Fundamentally, the idea you should take out of his work is that culture is a web of meaning, it connects people, places, things and ideas. All of these things can be represented through symbols we use. "Small facts can speak to large issues". A meme that's associated with boomers on FB, something that's small can talk to larger issues.

So last week, we talked about Stuart Hall, encoding/decoding, encoded by sender, decoded by receiver, dom, opp, negotiated. Two seperate people can receive the same message and come with radically different interpretations of what that meant. We can use Geertz's work to build on this. Thick Description.

In a nutshell, he argues in Thick Description that you can't describe a culture superficially. You need a context of these things. Why do things look a certain way?

> Observing two boys winking

Thin description vs thick description. Closing and opening an eyelid because he has a twitch. This is not a communicative act. He's not trying to send information. The other boy is _actively winking_, for a purpose. To "send a conspiratorial signal to a friend". The very same action, but this time it's meaningful. It's a communnicative act and sends some kind of information. These two acts look the same if you really boil it down. If you took a photograph of these boys doing this act, you can't tell the difference without context. Even though it's basically the same act, the point that I'm trying to make is that one is meaningful, other is not. The third boy, winking in imitation of the 1st boy's involuntary twitch. Without communicative intent, this twitch movement is a parody or mockery of what the first boy is doing and that makes all the difference.

#### Thin Description

The difference is that thin description is that these boys are winking. You describe what you see.

#### Thick Description

Thick description brings in the context, what it's hoping to accomplish and why.

Irony or anger, in their occurance is the... If we apply this idea to memes is that we should be aiming for a superficial thin description that "these are just a bunch of emojis", where each of these memes lies in the web of meaning. What role does it play in overall culture and what is it connected to?

#### Intertextuality

Thin description: eggplant with water squirting.

Thick description: you've already figured that out.

Thick description is hard. You need to know so many things.

If you looked at this on the boomer panel, what would you say about boomer humor? It'd be approval, etc. It's falling under dad-humor. Alot of millennials are reaching into the workforce, reflection of that. If you think about it, the way millenials are still characterized is that they've been kicked in the ribs their entire life.

[Deep fried memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deep-fried-memes), distorted, compression artifacts with shit all over it. In addition ot this random humor aspect of internet culture. Deep-fried is a commentary on the state of internet memes. Avante-garde. You can't break it down any more. The rest there's a but more meaning, whereas the 1920's, everything was recycled. People want stuff without extra stuff attached so I can "exist".

The death of the author, Barthes. Essentially, he talked about that it doesn't matter what the author said. your interpretations of it is no less valid than what was intentional.

GenZ memes are referencing their own memes.

Do you think the point is to confuse the old people (GenZ memes)?

In terms of intertextuality

It's also a classic reference to startrek the next generation. It's about how to commmunicate between people. It's from S05E02,

Is this loss?

![Loss by Tim Buckley](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d0/Loss_comic.jpg)

This reference to loss was a purist essene. 1: upright figure, 2: taller, shorter, 3: 2 upright, same size, 4: 1 vert, 1 horizontal.

Someone tok this photo, but also claimed it's loss.

In Toy Story, Is this loss

![Toy Story Loss](https://i.redd.it/1oi5m0g4kx811.jpg)

The encoding of these loss memes sort of became a marker of identity. The image on right became a way of figuring out people who know about it vs. It became a symbol of identity, an allusion to Kilory was here (from last lecture). That's kind of a deep part of internet history.

## OK or Not OK:

Paul McArtney, Barak Obama, and Ronald Reygan. Even before that it was OK. In Buddhism, it's a ritual with different meanings. In the 80's, it became associated with the circle game. The idea was to secretly make a circle and hide it by your side, at your waist, if you noticed someone doing it, they could punch you.

It was well enough known to be featured in Malcom in the Middle. [The Circle Game](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-circle-game)

![Circle](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/012/748/circle.jpg)

The whole circle game thing became a bit of a meme, it was funny, etc. In 2016-2017, 4chan and some other places / etc. tried to convince people this symbol stood for White Power. The idea here was that they'd have people make fake accounts, etc. to see if they could get lefties, sjws, etc. to pick it up and roll with it as a story. The goal was to prove they were so gullible that they'd take something like the OK symbol to make people think it's as-inappropriate...

The proud boys, people in law enforcement, military, etc. all started using it.

This has caught on to the point of the christ church shootings in NZ. He made this same symbol going into court. It sure does look like these people are using this symbol to communicate something that's more than just OK. It started as a prank to get journalists to reveal how gullible and stupid they are, but it's taken on meaning through these usages.

Just like Geertz talks about the wink, even if it's the same act, what you take from it depends on the context, the intent, and the cultural knowledge that surrounds that act. This could be something like the OK hand gesture being used...

No matter the original intent, it's being used unironically to if not

What I'm trying to argue is that something that is lost, it's a marker of identity. of group affiliation.

## James Carey

We can think of communication in 2 ways: transmission view and ritual view.

### Transmission

Transmission is giving useful info from point a to point b. This was dated, from A-B. These messages in the past were tied to transportation and driven by religious, politcal or (indistinguishable) means. Communication was viewed as a means... faster.

### Ritual

We can look at this a a way of finding, experiencing, and situating ourselves in the world. When we read the newspaper, we feel like we're part of a story. We're trying to figure out our place in all of these things. These concepts are not mutually exclusive. You normally do both. You figure out how you relate to the information being relayed in a transmission. You experince things like sharing, fellowship with other people. We feel like we have something in common with others.

It's not about the content of the message as much as it is about sending a message.

The wednesday frog. I don't post this to tell my friends that it's the 3rd day of the week. It's a statement of "here, i like this, send me a fb like or something haha". You're acknowledged me. It's like an "IN-Joke".

Something like a lost-meme or the OK/WP sign. Maybe that's OK, how are you doing, that was good, if you're doing it the other way "or whatever" it doesn't matter if you're saying "WP" that would intterperate it as WP. You can intterperate as shitposting.

### Symbolic Reality

It's about the cultural significance. They would argue through these that reality is created/produced through the symbolic relationships. Most of your assignments have a thin description part of your assignments.
exchange of meaning through language and symbols

1/3 descriptive. 2/3 interpretative. This is a guide on where to focus your energies. You may have to do some research, where did these memes come from, you can bring in non-academic sources for these.
