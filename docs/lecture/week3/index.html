Is there anyone who hasn&#x27;t interacted with TikTokers? I have some friends my age, they&#x27;re friends of tiktok. Everything that&#x27;s interesting is going to come to me on another platform. Tiktok seems to be like a generational marker. It&#x27;s the assumption that Zoomers and millennials.

As one of the most influential anthropologists of the time, he studied things like semiotics as a way to better understand society in culture. Of course, memes being often in the forms of signs and symbols, it&#x27;d be relevant here. Fundamentally, the idea you should take out of his work is that culture is a web of meaning, it connects people, places, things and ideas. All of these things can be represented through symbols we use. &quot;Small facts can speak to large issues&quot;. A meme that&#x27;s associated with boomers on FB, something that&#x27;s small can talk to larger issues.</p><p>So last week, we talked about Stuart Hall, encoding/decoding, encoded by sender, decoded by receiver, dom, opp, negotiated. Two seperate people can receive the same message and come with radically different interpretations of what that meant. We can use Geertz&#x27;s work to build on this. Thick Description.</p><p>In a nutshell, he argues in Thick Description that you can&#x27;t describe a culture superficially. You need a context of these things. Why do things look a certain way?</p><blockquote><p>Observing two boys winking</p></blockquote><p>Thin description vs thick description. Closing and opening an eyelid because he has a twitch. This is not a communicative act. He&#x27;s not trying to send information. The other boy is <em>actively winking</em>, for a purpose. To &quot;send a conspiratorial signal to a friend&quot;. The very same action, but this time it&#x27;s meaningful. It&#x27;s a communnicative act and sends some kind of information. These two acts look the same if you really boil it down. If you took a photograph of these boys doing this act, you can&#x27;t tell the difference without context. Even though it&#x27;s basically the same act, the point that I&#x27;m trying to make is that one is meaningful, other is not. The third boy, winking in imitation of the 1st boy&#x27;s involuntary twitch. Without communicative intent, this twitch movement is a parody or mockery of what the first boy is doing and that makes all the difference.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="thin-description"></a>Thin Description<a class="hash-link" href="#thin-description" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The difference is that thin description is that these boys are winking. You describe what you see.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="thick-description"></a>Thick Description<a class="hash-link" href="#thick-description" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Thick description brings in the context, what it&#x27;s hoping to accomplish and why.</p><p>Irony or anger, in their occurance is the... If we apply this idea to memes is that we should be aiming for a superficial thin description that &quot;these are just a bunch of emojis&quot;, where each of these memes lies in the web of meaning.

It&#x27;d be approval, etc. It&#x27;s falling under dad-humor. Alot of millennials are reaching into the workforce, reflection of that.

Even before that it was OK. In Buddhism, it&#x27;s a ritual with different meanings. In the 80&#x27;s, it became associated with the circle game. The idea was to secretly make a circle and hide it by your side, at your waist, if you noticed someone doing it, they could punch you.</p><p>It was well enough known to be featured in Malcom in the Middle. <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-circle-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Circle Game</a></p><p><img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/012/748/circle.jpg" alt="Circle"></p><p>The whole circle game thing became a bit of a meme, it was funny, etc. In 2016-2017, 4chan and some other places / etc. tried to convince people this symbol stood for White Power. The idea here was that they&#x27;d have people make fake accounts, etc. to see if they could get lefties, sjws, etc. to pick it up and roll with it as a story. The goal was to prove they were so gullible that they&#x27;d take something like the OK symbol to make people think it&#x27;s as-inappropriate...</p><p>The proud boys, people in law enforcement, military, etc. all started using it.</p><p>This has caught on to the point of the christ church shootings in NZ.
